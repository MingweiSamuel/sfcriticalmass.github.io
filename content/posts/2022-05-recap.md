Approximately one hundred people attended Critical Mass on May 27th. We left
Embarcadero Plaza at 6:30 pm sharp, headed down Market St to Valencia and up to
Dolores Park for the first stop. We continued down through the Mission and back
north up to Oracle Park where [SFSU's commencement ceremony](https://commencement.sfsu.edu/commencement-2022-may-27-oracle-park-sfsu-grad)
was taking place for our second stop.

Fireworks!

And the last leg continued along the
Embarcadero around to the final stop at the Aquatic Park Bleachers below
Ghirardelli Square. Total distance was about 12.5 miles, though several of us
continued as a group southbound on Polk St.

As part of this blog, I thought it might be nice to upload recaps
of each month's ride. So here's how the April 29 ride from last week went.
All things considered, the planned route worked better than expected! Many
people peeled off early but a handful of us completely a full 16 mile route
from Embarcadero Plaza to the Greay Walkway in about 3.5 hours.
